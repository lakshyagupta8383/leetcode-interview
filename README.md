# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my structured solutions to LeetCode problems.

The goal is not just solving problems, but building:
- Strong pattern recognition
- Clean implementation habits
- Faster recall during interviews
- Long-term retention through structured revision

## Repository Structure

Problems are organized by topic:

```
leetcode/
│
├── arrays/
├── binary-search/
├── sliding-window/
├── prefix-sum/
├── stack/
├── queue/
├── linked-list/
├── trees/
├── graphs/
├── dynamic-programming/
├── greedy/
├── heaps/
├── recursion/
├── backtracking/
└── strings/
```

Each folder contains C++ implementations of problems belonging to that pattern.

## Problem Documentation Format

Every problem follows a fixed structured template to reinforce understanding:

1. **Problem Summary**  
2. **My Thought Process**  
3. **How I Implemented It**  
4. **Key Insight**  
5. **Complexity (Time & Space)**  
6. **Mistakes / Edge Cases**  
7. **When To Revise**

This ensures:
- Pattern clarity
- Honest self-evaluation
- Stronger recall speed
- Fewer repeated mistakes

The focus is on reasoning, not just accepted submissions.
